# Welcome

Though I am relatively new and inexperienced when it comes to coding, I have over a decade of experience in the US Army understanding and developing solutions to problems faced by an organization. In addition, I have several years of experience specifically in applying data analytics to that problem solving process to reach data-driven decisions and conclusions.

## My Projects
### Professional

Presently, I work as an analyst for [McKesson Medical-Surgical](https://mms.mckesson.com/), working in support of the operations teams that provide medical supplies to skilled nursing facilities, outpatient centers, and clinics around the US. 

What McKesson work I can share publicly is [here](/mckesson/index.md).
