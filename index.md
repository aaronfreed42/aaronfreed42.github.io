# Welcome

Though I am relatively new and inexperienced when it comes to coding, I have over a decade of experience in the US Army understanding and developing solutions to problems faced by an organization. In addition, I have several years of experience specifically in applying data analytics to that problem solving process to reach data-driven decisions and conclusions.

## My Projects
### McKesson

Presently, I work as an analyst for [McKesson Medical-Surgical](https://mms.mckesson.com/), working in support of the operations teams that provide medical supplies to skilled nursing facilities, outpatient centers, and clinics around the US. 

What McKesson work I can share publicly is [here](/mckesson/index.md)

### College of William & Mary MSBA

To expand my coding and analytical skillsets I'm enrolled in the College of William & Mary's [Online Master's of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)](https://online.mason.wm.edu/msba) program! Hopefully you can learn something from what I share, or even better teach me something extra!

To adhere to the school's honor code, [the work I share](/MSBA/index.md) will be limited to what has been approved by my professors.
