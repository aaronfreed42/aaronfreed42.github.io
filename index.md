# Welcome

Though I am relatively new and inexperienced when it comes to coding, I have over a decade of experience in the US Army understanding and developing solutions to problems faced by an organization. In addition, I have several years of experience specifically in applying data analytics to that problem solving process to reach data-driven decisions and conclusions.

## My Projects
### McKesson

Presently, I work as an analyst for [McKesson Medical-Surgical](https://mms.mckesson.com/), working in support of the operations teams that provide medical supplies to skilled nursing facilities, outpatient centers, and clinics around the US. 

What McKesson work I can share publicly is [here](/mckesson/index.md)

### College of William & Mary MSBA

To expand my coding and analytical skillsets I'm in the College of William & Mary's [Online Master's of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)](https://online.mason.wm.edu/msba) program! To adhere to the school's honor code, I will only be sharing work that has been approved by my professors. Hopefully you can learn something from me, or even better teach me something extra!

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo

*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
